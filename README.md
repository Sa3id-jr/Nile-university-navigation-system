# Nile University Navigation System

This repository contains the **prototype version** of the Nile University Navigation System. The goal of this project is to provide a digital navigation solution for Nile University’s campus, assisting students, staff, and visitors in finding locations and directions efficiently.

## Project Status

> **Note:** This is a working prototype, not the final version. Some features may be incomplete or subject to change.

## Features (Prototype)

- Interactive campus map using **Leaflet**
- Room Connections feature (identify connections/adjacency between rooms)
- Navigation: Calculates shortest routes between university rooms/buildings using **Dijkstra's algorithm**
- Location search functionality
- User-friendly interface

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra’s algorithm for route calculation
- **Architecture:**
  - Frontend-only implementation
  - All logic handled client-side within browser
- **Project Structure:**
  - `/index.html` – main entry point
  - `/styles/` – CSS stylesheets
  - `/scripts/` – JavaScript files (including Dijkstra’s algorithm)
  - `/assets/` – images or other static resources (e.g., campus map images)
- **Browser Compatibility:**  
  Supports all modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

## Getting Started
